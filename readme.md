# Take Home Drag & Drop Project

### What we’d like you to build:
For this demo project, we would like you to use an existing boilerplate to to see your capabilities in reproducing a button based off a mockup. To the best of your ability, please reproduce the following button:

Please do not use Bootstrap or any other library, just adjust the button in src/components/button.js, and the CSS in src/assets/css/styles.css. To begin, the button is completely empty, just a silhouette. You will need to add other elements to recreate the example image.
